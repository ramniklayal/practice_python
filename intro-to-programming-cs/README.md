# Introduction to Programming and Computer Science

### Context

I am learning the basics of programming and computer science to better understand python, and keeping rough notes here for future reference.

#### Variables

Variables, in simple terms, is something that can store information. It can be referenced and manipulated as needed. A simple analogy for a variables is a cardboard box. Variables generally consists of name, type, and a piece of information.

There are many types of variables, but the most common ones are called _primitive type variables_. These are:
* Integer
* Boolean
* Float
* Double
* String
* Char

Integer, float and double can manipulated with basic math operations. Strings can be added.  Char's and boolean's cannot be operated on.

One rule to keep in mind is that variable names must be one continuous string. A common practice to satisfy this rule is camelCase, in which after the first word, every word's first letter is capitalized. Example - Roundfreezetime: Hard to read, roundFreezeTime: Easy to read
